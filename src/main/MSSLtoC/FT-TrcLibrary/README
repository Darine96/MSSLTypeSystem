To compile the library:

1) go in the directory src and type make. This should
produce the library libfthread.a. However, one assumes
that gcc, make, ar, and ranlib are available. If it is
not the case, you should edit the makefile to set correctly 
the corresponding variables.
   
2) type make install to install the file fthread.h in
../include and libfthread.a in ../lib. If these two items
are to be installed in an other place, edit the makefile
and change the two variables INCL_DIR and LIB_DIR.

3) you can verify that the installation is correct by
running the tests in the directory tests, or the examples
in the directory examples.
